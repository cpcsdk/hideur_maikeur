Installation guide
You need a compiler who supports makefiles like GNU GCC.

1- Choose a makefile for your plattform or edit the general Makefile :
   ->OS : edit it if you are under MSDOS/Windows
   ->LG : language
   ->CC : your favorite C compiler
   ->CLEAN : the system command to remove files (del on dos,...)
   ->etc...

2- Launch make

3- Type make clean to remove temporary object files

4- That's it
